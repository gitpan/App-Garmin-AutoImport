NAME
    App::Garmin::AutoImport - Import data from a Garmin device

VERSION
    0.90

DESCRIPTION
    The "garmin-autoimport" application is used to import data from a Garmin
    device such as the Forerunner 305, but will work with any other Garmin
    device supported by garmin-forerunner-tools
    <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/garmin-forerunner-tools>.

    The application is supposed to be autostarted in a destop environment
    (such as Ubuntu <http://ubuntu.com>). It will then detect when a Garmin
    device is connected and start downloading new track logs from the device
    and save them to "Documents/garmin" in the current user's home
    directory.

    This program can also be installed from a debian package. This is highly
    suggested, since the Perl modules required to run this application might
    be difficult to install, even with tools like cpanm.

    The debian package can be found here:
    <https://github.com/jhthorsen/app-garmin-autoimport/raw/master/dist/garm
    in-autoimport_0.90_all.deb>

SYNOPSIS
      use App::Garmin::AutoImport;
      exit App::Garmin::AutoImport->new->run;

    Or use the "garmin-autoimport" application bundled to this package.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    *   NO_NOTIFICATIONS

        Will not load Gtk2::Notify and will not send notifications to the
        desktop environment.

    *   GARMIN_ID_VENDOR

        Set this if you got a Garmin device which does not have the USB
        vendor ID "0x091e".

ATTRIBUTES
  id_product
    Returns the USB ID of the Garmin product. Default is 0.

  id_vendor
    Returns the USB ID of the Garmin vendor. Default is the
    "GARMIN_ID_VENDOR" "ENVIRONMENT" variable.

METHODS
  new
      $self = $class->new(\%args);
      $self = $class->new(%args);

    Object constructor. %args can have:

    *   id_product

        Defaults to 0, which enable it to be set by "auto_detect_device".

    *   id_vendor

        Defaults to "GARMIN_ID_VENDOR".

    *   output_dir

        Defaults to "$ENV{HOME}/Documents/garmin".

  auto_detect_device
      $self->auto_detect_device;

    This method starts by checking if a Garmin device is already connected.
    If not found, it will check for a new device and use the first that is
    found.

    This method sets "id_product" and id_vendor.

  notify
      $self->notify($message);
      $self->notify($title, $message);

    Notify the user using Gtk2::Notify which sends popup notifictions to the
    desktop environment.

  run
      $self->run;

    Will run the application inside a never ending loop. Calls
    "auto_detect_device" until "id_product" is detected and starts
    "garmin_save_runs" once the Garmin device is connected.
